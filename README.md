# Crack detection and classification using OpenCV

### Abstract
It has been seen that millions of dollars are being invested on highway/subway tunnel maintainance and restoration all over the world. This cost can be minimized if the detection of cracks will be found as earlier as possible. As the reparation process depends on the type of cracks, so we need to take actions for next steps how it would be repaired. It would be a very good decision to repair the cracks as earliar we find it. Initially we need to capture very transperant images of the roads/concrete infrastuctures. Cause detections will depend on that images. So any device that will be used to scan or capture images of the roads/concrete infrastuctures, that must be configured for picturing high resolution images. On those images, various image processing techniques are applied to extract crack information. Depending on these information, the images could be classified using some decision making algorithm. This procedure can be implemented on images acquired by any objects or vehicles carrying image sensing terminal, laser distance sensor, image storage and processing servers, central control system and speed sensor. The accuracy depends on the images quality and accurate capture.

### Introduction
Whenever we travel what we need at first is road safety. So if we can confirm that conditions of our highway is okay, then accidents will be decreased automatically. Since the highways are built, it can be seen the cracks or holes in the asphalt/concrete surface. As soon as we repair our cracks, our journey will be safe for sure. Most of cases the accidents happen due to the poor condition of the road.

In very modern countries, they have thousands of kilometers highways. It's very difficult to inspect these roads by manpower. So an efficient automatic detection of the road condition can be developed for making them safe.

These cracks of the highways can be classified into some types. Depending on those cracks, authority must take actions how those would have to repair. Initially it may need to detect the location of the cracks. To perform that, a visual inspection technique is needed to capture images of the roads and then to be analyzed.

So our ultimate goal is to develop a system that can be able to detect these cracks on the highways automatically.
